# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
## Summary
In this project we take an aim at building out our first fully online dashboard. The goal is to display the research data with a simple dropdown menu that allows the user to select the participant data they would like to view. The user will see the dashboard be populated with participant information and featured visualizations.

Featured visualization includes

* Top 10 prominent bacteria culture of the participant.
* Number of times participant wash their belly button.
* Bubble chart displaying all the operational taxonomic units of the biodiversity of the participant.
